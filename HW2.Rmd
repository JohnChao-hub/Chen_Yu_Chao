1.
It's a data frame.
There are four variables. Murder and Rape are doubles. Assault and UrbanPop are integers.
And the data set have 50 observations.
```{r}
data(USArrests)
str(USArrests)
```

2.
```{r}
USArrests %>%
  map_dbl(max)

row.names(USArrests)[map_dbl(USArrests,which.max)]

cat("North Carolina has the largest number of Assaults")
```

3.
```{r}
library(nycflights13)
flights
```

4.
```{r}
str(flights) #tibble [336,776 Ã— 19]
typeof(flights)
class(flights) #  It's a tibble.
```
The flights contains 336,766 rows and 19 columns. 
It provides the actual departure and arrival times and scheduled departure and arrival times.
Comparing to data.frame, tibble is more easily to browse the data set.

5.
```{r}
flights %>% 
  map(typeof)
```

6.
```{r}
 models <- iris %>%
  split(.$Species) %>%
   map(~lm(Sepal.Length~Sepal.Width , data = .)) 

models
```

7.
```{r}
V <-  list(12, 22, 27, 31.5, NA, 39, "east")

length(V) #7a
V[is.na(V)] #7b
V[[3]] #7c
V[c(which.min(V[map(V,class)=="numeric"]),which(map(V,class)=="character"))] #7d
class(V[[7]]) #7e
```

```{r}

```
